PURPOSE OF PROJECT

This project is a final product after learning 3 weeks in a Front-End Web Development Bootcamp by General Assembly. This website is built from scratch mainly using HTML,CSS and JavaScript only. There's a lot new things that I learnt and applied to this website especially in using grid and flexbox. I also understand better on the usage of absolute and relative in background-image. Other than that, I managed to implement an interactive hamburger menu using Javascript. This website cannot be done well without the help from teachers in General Assembly especially Ebere Iwaela, Osman Ali and Mohd Izzuddin Eshak.
